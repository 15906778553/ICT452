      <P>CRM</P>
      <ol>
        <li>This is a simple definition of CRM.
            Customer relationship management (CRM) is 
            a technology for managing all your company’s 
            relationships and interactions with customers
             and potential customers. The goal is simple: 
             Improve business relationships to grow your
              business. A CRM system helps companies stay 
              connected to customers, streamline processes,
               and improve profitability.
            
            When people talk about CRM, they are usually 
            referring to a CRM system, a tool that helps
             with contact management, sales management, 
             agent productivity, and more. CRM tools can now 
             be used to manage customer relationships across 
             the entire customer lifecycle, spanning marketing,
              sales, digital commerce, and customer service interactions.
            
            A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization’s
             relationships with individual people — including customers,
              service users, colleagues, or suppliers — throughout your 
              lifecycle with them, including finding new customers, winning
               their business, and providing support and additional services 
               throughout the relationship.</li>
        <li>Who is CRM for?
            A CRM system gives everyone 
            — from sales, customer service,
             business development, recruiting, 
             marketing, or any other line of business
              — a better way to manage the external interactions
               and relationships that drive success. A CRM tool lets you 
               store customer and prospect contact information, identify 
               sales opportunities, record service issues, and manage marketing 
               campaigns, all in one central location — and make information about 
               every customer interaction available to anyone at your company who 
               might need it.
            
            With visibility and easy access to data, it's easier to collaborate 
            and increase productivity. Everyone in your company can see how customers
             have been communicated with, what they’ve bought, when they last purchased,
              what they paid, and so much more. CRM can help companies of all sizes drive 
              business growth, and it can be especially beneficial to a small business, where 
              teams often need to find ways to do more with less.</li>
        <li>What does a CRM system do?
            A customer relationship management 
            (CRM) solution helps you find new customers,
             win their business, and keep them happy by 
             organizing customer and prospect information
              in a way that helps you build stronger relationships
               with them and grow your business faster. CRM systems 
               start by collecting a customer's website, email, telephone,
                and social media data — and more — across multiple sources and
                 channels. It may also automatically pull in other information, 
                 such as recent news about the company's activity, and it can store
                  personal details, such as a client's personal preferences on communications.
                   The CRM tool organizes this information to give you a complete record of 
                   individuals and companies overall, so you can better understand your 
                   relationship over time.</li>
